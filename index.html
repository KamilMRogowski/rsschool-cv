      <h3>Your new Junior front-end developer</h3>
      <p>
        As a candidate for my first frontend developer role, I have a strong
        grasp of HTML, solid fundamentals of CSS including responsive layouts,
        and a basic understanding of React. Additionally, I possess a good
        understanding of Git version control. My personal philosophy, influenced
        by stoicism, informs my approach to work, emphasizing simplicity,
        efficiency, and self-discipline. I take a logical and objective approach
        to problem-solving, welcome constructive feedback, and thrive on
        collaborating with my team to achieve project success. Moreover, I am a
        fast learner and adept at acquiring knowledge from various sources,
        allowing me to adapt quickly to new technologies and challenges. I am
        excited to apply my skills and contribute to the success of the company
        in this role.
