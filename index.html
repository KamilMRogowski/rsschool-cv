        This is the project created during Frontend Masters courses. It is a
        clone of a popular game "Wordle". The game accepts user input from a
        keyboard and displays entered letters. After pressing enter app firstly
        connects to Frontend Masters API to chceck whether the word exists, then
        another API checks if this word is the word of the day, which is also
        fetched from API. In case of win, user gets congratulation message,
        after 6 tries there is message about losing and todays word is
        presented. If word exists and is incorrect, adequate css styles are
        apllied to indicate which letters are correct.
